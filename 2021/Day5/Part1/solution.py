# --- Day 5: Hydrothermal Venture ---
# You come across a field of hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor! These vents constantly produce large, opaque clouds, so it would be best to avoid them if possible.

# They tend to form in lines; the submarine helpfully produces a list of nearby lines of vents (your puzzle input) for you to review. For example:

# 0,9 -> 5,9
# 8,0 -> 0,8
# 9,4 -> 3,4
# 2,2 -> 2,1
# 7,0 -> 7,4
# 6,4 -> 2,0
# 0,9 -> 2,9
# 3,4 -> 1,4
# 0,0 -> 8,8
# 5,5 -> 8,2
# Each line of vents is given as a line segment in the format x1,y1 -> x2,y2 where x1,y1 are the coordinates of one end the line segment and x2,y2 are the coordinates of the other end. 
# These line segments include the points at both ends. In other words:

# An entry like 1,1 -> 1,3 covers points 1,1, 1,2, and 1,3.
# An entry like 9,7 -> 7,7 covers points 9,7, 8,7, and 7,7.
# For now, only consider horizontal and vertical lines: lines where either x1 = x2 or y1 = y2.

# So, the horizontal and vertical lines from the above list would produce the following diagram:

# .......1..
# ..1....1..
# ..1....1..
# .......1..
# .112111211
# ..........
# ..........
# ..........
# ..........
# 222111....
# In this diagram, the top left corner is 0,0 and the bottom right corner is 9,9. Each position is shown as the number of lines which cover that point or . if no line covers that point. 
# The top-left pair of 1s, for example, comes from 2,2 -> 2,1; the very bottom row is formed by the overlapping lines 0,9 -> 5,9 and 0,9 -> 2,9.

# To avoid the most dangerous areas, you need to determine the number of points where at least two lines overlap. 
# In the above example, this is anywhere in the diagram with a 2 or larger - a total of 5 points.

# Consider only horizontal and vertical lines. At how many points do at least two lines overlap?
